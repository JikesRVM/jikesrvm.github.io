<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Most Java runtimes rely upon the foreign language APIs of the underlying
platform operating system to implement runtime behaviour which involves
interaction with the underlying platform. Runtimes also occasionally employ small
segments of machine code to provide access to platform hardware state. Note
that this is expedient rather than mandatory. With a suitably smart Java
bytecode compiler it would be quite possible to implement a full Java-in-Java
runtime i.e. one comprising only compiled Java code (the JNode project is an
attempt to implement a runtime along these lines; the Xerox, MIT, Lambda
and TI Explorer Lisp machine implementations and the Xerox Smalltalk
implementation were highly successful attemtps at fully compiled language
runtimes).

sequence of machine code that swaps out old thread registers and swaps in new
ones, switching execution to the new thread’s stack resumed at its saved
PC

<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >All the methods in <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

memory or other machine state, perform unsafe casts, or are operating system calls,
they cannot be implemented in Java code.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >A Jikes<sup class="textsuperscript"><span

class="cmti-10">extremely careful </span>when writing code that uses
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Magic</span></span></span> to circumvent the Java type system. The use of <span 
class="cmtt-10">Magic.objectAsAddress </span>to
perform various forms of pointer arithmetic is especially hazardous, since it can result
in pointers being ”lost” during garbage collection. All such uses of magic must either
occur in uninterruptible methods or be guarded by calls to <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">VM.disableGC</span></span></span> and
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">VM.enableGC</span></span></span>. The optimizing compiler performs aggressive inlining and code motion,
so not explicitly marking such dangerous regions in one of these two manners will
lead to disaster.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Since magic is inexpressible in the Java programming language , it is unsurprising
that the bodies of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Magic</span></span></span> methods are undeﬁned. Instead, for each of these methods,
the Java instructions to generate the code is stored in <span 
class="cmtt-10">GenerateMagic </span>and
<span 
class="cmtt-10">GenerateMachineSpecificMagic </span>(to generate HIR) and the baseline compilers (to
generate assembly code) (Note: The optimizing compiler always uses the set of
instructions that generate HIR; the instructions that generate assembly code are only
invoked by the baseline compiler.). Whenever the compiler encounters a call to one of
these magic methods, it inlines appropriate code for the magic method into the caller
method.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The type <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

type. <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">org.vmmagic.Address</span></span></span> is an <a 
href="#x18-21700015.2">unboxed type</a>. In the past, the base type <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> was
used to represent addresses but this approach had several shortcomings. First, the
lack of abstraction makes porting nightmarish. Equally important is that Java type
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> is signed whereas addresses are more appropriately considered unsigned. The
diﬀerence is problematic since an unsigned comparison on <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> is inexpressible in the
Java programming language.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >To overcome these problems, instances of <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">org.vmmagic.Address</span></span></span> are used to
represent addresses. The class supports the expected well-typed methods like adding
an integer oﬀset to an address to obtain another address, computing the
diﬀerence of two addresses, and comparing addresses. Other operations that
make sense on <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">int</span></span></span> but not on addresses are excluded like multiplication of
addresses. Two methods deserve special attention: converting an address
into an integer and the inverse. These methods should be avoided where
possible.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Without special intervention, using a Java object to represent an address would be at
best abysmally ineﬃcient. Instead, when the Jikes RVM compiler encounters creation
of an address object, it will return the primitive value that represents an address for
that platform. Currently, the address type maps to either a 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned
integer. Since an address is an unboxed type it must obey the rules outlined in
<a

 id="x18-21900015.4"></a>Uninterruptible Code</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Declaring a method uninterruptible enables a Jikes RVM developer to prevent the
Jikes RVM compilers from inserting ”hidden” thread switch points in the compiled
code for the method. As a result, the code can be written assuming that it cannot
involuntarily ”lose control” while executing due to a timer-driven thread switch. In
particular, neither yield points nor stack overﬂow checks will be generated for
uninterruptible methods. When writing uninterruptible code, the programmer is
restricted to a subset of the Java language. The following are the restrictions on
uninterruptible code.
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Because a stack overﬂow check represents a potential yield point (if GC is
     triggered when the stack is grown), stack overﬂow checks are omitted from
     the prologues of uninterruptible code. As a result, all uninterruptible code
     must be able to execute in the stack space available to them when the ﬁrst
     uninterruptible method on the call stack is invoked. This is typically about
     8K for uninterruptible regions called from mutator code. The collector
     threads must preallocate enough stack space, since all collector code is
     uninterruptible. As a result, using recursive methods in the GC subsystem
                                                                  

                                                                  
     is a bad idea.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Since no yield points are inserted in uninterruptible code, there will be
     no timer-driven thread switches while executing it. So, if possible, one
     should avoid ”long running” uninterruptible methods outside of the GC
     subsystem.
     </li>
