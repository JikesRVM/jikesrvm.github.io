<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >A comprehensive discussion of the design and implementation of the original Jikes
RVM adaptive optimization system is given in the OOPSLA 2000 paper by Arnold,
Fink, Grove, Hind and Sweeney. A number of aspects of the system have been
changed since 2000, so a better resource is a technical report <a 
href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/30c2b5bb5352443885256f550066b5c1%21OpenDocument" >Nov. 2004 technical
report</a> that describes the architecture and implementation in some detail.
This section of the userguide is based on section 5 of the 2004 technical
report.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The implementation of the Jikes RVM adaptive optimization system uses a number
of Java threads: several organizer threads in the runtime measurements component,
the controller thread, and the compilation thread. The various threads are loosely
                                                                  

                                                                  
coupled, communicating with each other through shared queues and/or the
other in memory data structures. All queues in the system are blocking
priority queues; if a consumer thread performs a dequeue operation when the
queue is empty, it suspends until a producer thread performs an enqueue
operation.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The adaptive optimization system performs two primary tasks: selective optimization
and proﬁle-directed inlining.
</p>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x15-15000012"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Selective Optimization</span></span>
The goal of selective optimization is to identify regions of code in which the
application spends signiﬁcant execution time (often called “hot spots”), determine if
overall application performance is likely to be improved by further optimizing one or
more hot spots, and if so to invoke the optimizing compiler and install the resulting
optimized code in the virtual machine.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >In Jikes RVM, the unit of optimization is a method. Thus, to perform selective
optimization, ﬁrst the runtime measurements component must identify candidate
methods (“hot methods”) for the controller to consider. To this end, it installs a
listener that periodically samples the currently executing method at every taken
yieldpoint. When it is time to take a sample, the listener inspects the thread’s call
stack and records a single compiled method id into a buﬀer. If the yieldpoint occurs
in the prologue of a method, then the listener additionally records the compiled
method id of the current activation’s caller. If the taken yieldpoint occurs on a loop
backedge or method epilogue, then the listener records the compiled method id of the
current method.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >When the buﬀer of samples is full, the sampling window ends. The listener then
unregisters itself (stops taking samples) and wakes the sleeping Hot Method
Organizer. The Hot Method Organizer processes the buﬀer of compiled method ids
by updating the Method Sample Data. This data structure maintains, for every
compiled method, the total number of times that it has been sampled. Careful design
of this data structure (<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MethodCountData.java</span></span></span>) was critical to achieving low proﬁling
overhead. In addition to supporting lookups and updates by compiled method id, it
must also eﬃciently enumerate all methods that have been sampled more times
than a (varying) threshold value. After updating the Method Sample Data,
the Hot Method Organizer creates an event for each method that has been
sampled in this window and adds it to the controller’s priority queue, using the
sample value as its priority. The event contains the compiled method and the
<span 
class="cmti-10">total </span>number of times it has been sampled since the beginning of execution.
After enqueuing the last event, the Hot Method Organizer re-registers the
method listener and then sleeps until the next buﬀer of samples is ready to be
processed.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >When the priority queue delivers an event to the controller, the controller dequeues
the event and applies the model-driven recompilation policy to determine what
action (if any) to take for the indicated method. If the controller decides to recompile
the method, it creates a recompilation event that describes the method to be
compiled and the optimization plan to use and places it on the recompilation
queue. The recompilation queue prioritizes events based on the cost-beneﬁt
computation.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >When an event is available on the recompilation queue, the recompilation thread
removes it and performs the compilation activity speciﬁed by the event. It invokes
the optimizing compiler at the speciﬁed optimization level and installs the resulting
                                                                  

                                                                  
compiled method into the VM.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Although the overall structure of selective optimization in Jikes RVM is similar to
that originally described in Arnold et al’s OOPSLA 2000 paper, we have made
several changes and improvements based on further experience with the system. The
most signiﬁcant change is that in the previous system, the method sample organizer
attempted to ﬁlter the set of methods it presented to the controller. The
organizer passed along to the controller only methods considered ”hot”. The
organizer deemed a method ”hot” if the percentage of samples attributed
to the method exceeded a dynamically adjusted threshold value. Method
samples were periodically decayed to give more weight to recent samples.
The controller dynamically adjusted this threshold value and the size of the
sampling window in an attempt to reduce the overhead of processing the
samples.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Later, signiﬁcant algorithmic improvements in key data structures and additional
performance tuning of the listeners, organizers, and controller reduced AOS overhead
by two orders of magnitude. These overhead reductions obviate the need
to ﬁlter events passed to the controller. This resulted in a more eﬀective
system with fewer parameters to tune and a sounder theoretical basis. In
general, as we gained experience with the adaptive system implementation, we
strove to reduce the number of tuning parameters. We believe that the closer
the implementation matches the basic theoretical cost-beneﬁt model, the
more likely it will perform well and make reasonable and understandable
decisions.

 id="x15-15100012"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Proﬁle-Directed Inlining</span></span>
Proﬁle-directed inlining attempts to identify frequently traversed call graph edges,
which represent caller-callee relationships, and determine whether it is beneﬁcial to
recompile the caller methods to allow inlining of the callee methods. In Jikes RVM,
proﬁle-directed inlining augments a number of static inlining heuristics. The
role of proﬁle-directed inlining is to identify high cost-high beneﬁt inlining
opportunities that evade the static heuristics and to predict the likely target(s) of
invokevirtual and invokeinterface calls that could not be statically bound at compile
time.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >To accomplish this goal, the system takes a statistical sample of the method calls in
the running application and maintains an approximation of the dynamic call graph
based on this data. The system installs a listener that samples call edges whenever
a yieldpoint is taken in the prologue or epilogue of a method. To sample
the call edge, it records the compiled method id of the caller and callee
methods and the oﬀset of the call instruction in the caller’s machine code into
a buﬀer. When the buﬀer of samples is full, the sampling window ends.
The listener then unregisters itself (stops taking samples) and wakes an
organizer to update the dynamic call graph with the new proﬁle data. The
optimizing compiler’s Inline Oracle uses the dynamic call graph to guide it’s inline
decisions.
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The system currently used is based on Arnold &#x0026; Grove’s CGO 2005 paper. More
details of the sampling scheme and the inlining oracle can be found there, or in the
source code.

 id="x15-15200012.1"></a>AOS Controller</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >A primary design goal for the adaptive optimization system is to enable research in
online feedback-directed optimization. Therefore, we require the controller
implementation to be ﬂexible and extensible. As we gained experience with the
system, the controller component went through several major redesigns to better
support our goals.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The controller is a single Java thread that runs an inﬁnite event loop. After
initializing AOS, the controller enters the event loop and attempts to dequeue an
event. If no event is available, the dequeue operation blocks (suspending the
controller thread) until an event is available. All controller events implement an
interface with a single method: process. Thus, after successfully dequeuing an event
the controller thread simply invokes its process method and then, the work for that
event having been completed, returns to the top of the event loop and attempts to
dequeue another event. This design makes it easy to add new kinds of events to the
system (and thus, extend the controller’s behavior), as all of the logic to process an
event is deﬁned by the event’s process method, not in the code of the controller
thread.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >A further level of abstraction is accomplished by representing the recompilation
strategy as an abstract class with several subclasses. The process method of a hot
method event invokes methods of the recompilation strategy to determine whether or
not a method should be recompiled, and if so at what optimization level. The
cost-beneﬁt model itself is also reiﬁed in a class hierarchy of models to enable
extension and variation. This set of abstractions enable a single controller
implementation to execute a variety of strategies.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Another useful mechanism for experimentation is the ability to easily change the
input parameters to AOS that deﬁne the expected compilation rates and
execution speed of compiled code for the various compilers. By varying these
parameters, one can easily cause the default multi-level cost-beneﬁt model to
simulate a single-level model (by deﬁning all but one optimization level to be
unproﬁtable). One can also explore other aspects of the system, for example the
sensitivity of the model to the accuracy of these parameters. We found this
capability to be so useful that the system supports a command line argument
(<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:aos:dna=&#x003C;filename&#x003E;</span></span></span>) that causes it to optionally read these parameters from a
ﬁle.

 id="x15-15300012.2"></a>Cost Beneﬁt Model</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM Adaptive Optimization System attempts to evaluate the break-even
point for each action using an online competitive algorithm. It relies on an analytic
model to estimate the costs and beneﬁts of each selective recompilation
action, and evaluates the best actions according to the model predictions
online.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >A key advantage of this approach is that it allows a designer to extend the simple
”break-even” cost-beneﬁt model to account for more sophisticated adaptive policies,
such as selective compilation with multiple optimization levels, on-stack-replacement,
and long-running analyses.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >In general, each potential action will incur some cost and may confer some beneﬁt.
For example, recompiling a method will certainly consume some CPU cycles, but
could speed up the program execution by generating better code. In this
discussion we focus on costs and beneﬁts deﬁned in terms of time (CPU
cycles). However, in general, the controller could consider other measures of
cost and beneﬁt, such as memory footprint, garbage allocated, or locality
disrupted.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >The controller will take some action when it estimates the beneﬁt to exceed the cost.
More precisely, when the controller wakes at time <span

execution time will not change. This implies that if the controller were to consider a
method that does not appear in the previous sampling interval, the controller would
make exactly the same decision it did the last time it considered the method. This

 id="x15-15400012.3"></a>Jikes RVM’s compilers</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Jikes RVM invokes a compiler for one of three reasons. First, when the executing
code reaches an unresolved reference, causing a new class to be loaded, the
class loader invokes a compiler to compile the class initializer (if one exists).
Second, the system compiles each method the ﬁrst time it is invoked. In these
ﬁrst two scenarios, the initiating application thread stalls until compilation
completes.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >In the third scenario, the adaptive optimization system can invoke a compiler when
proﬁling data suggests that <span 
class="cmti-10">recompiling </span>a method with additional optimizations may
be beneﬁcial. The system supports both background and foreground recompilation.
With background recompilation (the default), a dedicated thread asynchronously
performs all recompilations. With foreground conﬁguration, the system invalidates a
compiled method, thus, forcing recompilation at the desired optimization
level at the next invocation (stalling the invoking thread until compilation
completes).
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >The system includes two compilers with diﬀerent tradeoﬀs between compilation
overhead and code quality. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The  goal  of  the  <span 
class="cmti-10">baseline  </span>compiler  is  to  generate  correct  code  quickly.
                                                                  

                                                                  
     For  example,  the  IA32  baseline  compiler  translates  bytecodes  directly
     into native code by simulating Java’s operand stack. It does not build
     an intermediate representation and does not perform register allocation,
     resulting in native code that executes only somewhat faster than bytecode
     interpretation. However, it does achieve its goal of producing this code
     quickly, which signiﬁcantly reduces the initial overhead associated with
     dynamic compilation.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The <span 
class="cmti-10">optimizing </span>compiler translates bytecodes into an intermediate
     representation, upon which it performs a variety of optimizations. All
     optimization levels include linear scan register allocation and BURS-based
     instruction selection. The compiler’s optimizations are grouped into several
     levels:
         <ul class="itemize2">
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Level 0 </span>consists of a set of ﬂow-sensitive optimizations performed
         on-the-ﬂy during the translation from bytecodes to the intermediate
         representation  and  some  additional  optimizations  that  are  either
         highly eﬀective or have negligible compilation costs. The compiler
         performs the following optimizations during IR generation: constant,
         type, non-null, and copy propagation, constant folding and arithmetic
         simpliﬁcation, branch optimizations, ﬁeld analysis, unreachable code
         elimination,  inlining  of  trivial  methods  (A  trivial  method  is  one
         whose  body  is  estimated  to  take  less  code  space  than  2  times
         the size of a calling sequence and that can be inlined without an
         explicit guard.), elimination of redundant nullchecks, checkcasts, and
         array  store  checks.  As  these  optimizations  reduce  the  size  of  the
         generated IR, performing them tends to reduce overall compilation
         time.  Level  0  includes  a  number  of  cheap  local  (The  scope  of  a
         local optimization is one extended basic block.) optimizations such
         as local redundancy elimination (common subexpression elimination,
         loads, and exception checks), copy propagation, constant propagation
         and folding. Level 0 also includes simple control ﬂow optimizations
         such as static basic block splitting, peephole branch optimization,
         and tail recursion elimination. Finally, Level 0 performs simple code
         reordering, scalar replacement of aggregates and short arrays, and one
         pass of intraprocedural ﬂow-insensitive copy propagation, constant
         propagation, and dead assignment elimination.
         </li>
         <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-10">Level   1  </span>resembles   Level   0,   but   signiﬁcantly   increases   the
         aggressiveness  of  inlining  heuristics.  The  compiler  performs  both
         unguarded  inlining  of  ﬁnal  and  static  methods  and  (speculative)
         guarded   inlining   of   non-ﬁnal   virtual   and   interface   methods.
         Speculative inlining is driven both by class hierarchy analysis and
         online proﬁle data gathered by the adaptive system. In addition, the
         compiler exploits “preexistence” to safely perform unguarded inlining
         of some invocations of non-ﬁnal virtual methods <span 
class="cmti-10">without </span>requiring
         stack frame rewriting on invalidation. It also runs multiple passes of
         some of the Level 0 optimizations and uses a more sophisticated code

         common  subexpression  elimination,  redundant  and  conditional

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >The adaptive system uses information about average compilation rate and relative
speed of compiled code produced by each compiler/optimization level to make its
decisions. These characteristics of the compilers are the key inputs to enable selective
optimization to be eﬀective. It allows one to employ a quick executing compiler for
infrequently executed methods and an optimizing compiler for the most critical
methods. See <span

 id="x15-15500012.4"></a>Life Cycle of a Compiled Method</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >In early implementations of Jikes RVM’s adaptive system, compilation required
holding a global lock that serialized compilation and also prevented classloading from
occurring concurrently with compilation. This bottleneck was removed in version
2.1.0 by switching to a ﬁner-grained locking discipline to coordinate compilation,
speculative optimization, and class loading. Since no published description of this
locking protocol exists outside of the source code, we brieﬂy summarize the life cycle
of a compiled method here.
</p><!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >When Jikes RVM compiles a method, it creates a compiled method object to
represent this particular compilation of the source method. A compiled method has a
unique id, and stores the compiled code and associated compiler meta-data. After a
brief initialization phase, the compiled method transitions from uncompiled to
compiling when compilation begins. During compilation, the optimizing
compiler may perform speculative optimizations that can be invalidated
by future class loading. Each time the compiler so speculates, it records a
relevant entry in an invalidation database. Upon ﬁnishing compilation, the
system checks to ensure that the current compilation has not already been
invalidated by concurrent classloading. If it has not, then the system installs the
compiled code, and subsequent invocations will branch to the newly created
code.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >Each time a class is loaded, the system checks the invalidation database
to identify the set of compiled methods to mark as obsolete, because this
classloading action invalidates speculative optimizations previously applied to that
method. A method may transition from either compiling or installed to obsolete
                                                                  

                                                                  
due to a classloading-induced invalidation. A method can also transition
from installed to obsolete when the adaptive system selects a method for
optimizing recompilation and a new compiled method is installed to replace
it.

<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Once a method is marked obsolete, it will never be invoked again. However, before
the generated code for the compiled method can be garbage collected, all existing
invocations of the compiled method must be complete. A compiled method
transitions from obsolete to dead when no invocations of it exist on any thread
stack. Jikes RVM detects this as part of the stack scanning phase of garbage
collection; as stack frames are scanned, their compiled methods are marked
as active. Any obsolete method that is not marked as active when stack
scanning completes is marked as dead and the reference to it is removed from
the compiled method table. It will then be freed during the next garbage
collection.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">12.5   </span> <a 
 id="x15-15600012.5"></a>Logging and Debugging</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Complex non-deterministic systems such as the Jikes RVM adaptive system present
challenges for system understanding and debugging. Virtually all of the
proﬁling data collected by the runtime measurements component results from
non-deterministic timer-based sampling at taken yieldpoints. The exact timing of
these interrupts, and thus, the proﬁle data that drives recompilation decisions,
diﬀers somewhat each time an application executes. Furthermore, many
of the optimizations in the optimizing compiler rely on online proﬁles of
conditional branch probabilities, i.e., the probabilities at the point in an
execution when the recompilation occurs. Thus, because recompilations can
occur at diﬀerent times during each execution, a method compiled at the
same optimization level could be compiled slightly diﬀerently on diﬀerent
runs.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The primary mechanism we use to manage this complexity is a record-replay facility
for the adaptive system, where online proﬁle data is gathered during one run and
used in a subsequent run. More speciﬁcally, as methods are dynamically compiled,
the system can record this information into a log ﬁle. At the end of the run, the
system can optionally dump the branch probabilities of all instrumented conditional
branches, the proﬁle-derived call graph, and the proﬁle-directed inlining decisions.
This log of methods and the ﬁles of proﬁle data can then be provided as inputs to a
driver program (<span 
class="cmtt-10">org.jikesrvm.tools.opt.OptTestHarness</span>) that can replay
the series of compilation actions, and then optionally execute the program.
Usually a fairly rapid binary search of methods being compiled and/or the
supporting proﬁle data suﬃces to narrow the cause of a crash to a small set of
actions taken by the optimizing compiler. Although this does not enable a
perfectly accurate replay of a previous run, in practice, we have found that it
suﬃces to reproduce almost all crashes caused by bugs in the optimizing
compiler.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >In addition to this record-replay mechanism, which mainly helps debugging the
optimizing compiler, the adaptive system can generate a log ﬁle that contains
detailed information about the actions of its organizer and controller threads. A
sample is shown below:

<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >This sample shows an abbreviated subset of the log entries associated with the
method read of the class <span 
class="cmtt-10">spec.benchmarks.</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_213</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_javac.ScannerInputStream</span>, one
of the hotter methods of the SPECjvm98 benchmark <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">_213_javac</span></span></span>. The ﬁrst pair of
numbers are the controller clock (number of timer interrupts since execution
began) and the value of the hardware cycle counter (<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">Time.cycles()</span></span></span>) for the
log entry. These log entries show the cost-beneﬁt values computed by the
controller for various possible optimization actions and the progression of the
method from baseline compilation through two recompilations (level 0 and
then at level 1). For example, at time 92, we see four entries that give the
estimated total future time (the sum of the compilation cost and the total future
execution time in a method) for performing no recompilation and for each
optimization level. Because the total future time for not recompiling (40)
is less than the other alternatives (49<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>81, 72<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>58, and 213<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>49), the method
is not scheduled for recompilation. However, at time 110, the method has
been sampled more often. Thus, the total future time estimate is updated,
resulting in two recompilation actions (level 0 and level 1) that are more
attractive than taking no recompilation action. Because level 0 gives the
least future time, this decision is chosen by placing a recompilation event in
the recompilation priority queue. The priority for the event is the expected
improvement of performing this recompilation, i.e., the diﬀerence between
the future time for the new level and the future time for current execution
(90 <span 
class="cmsy-10">− </span>61<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>54 = 28<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>46).
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >At clock time 150 a similar pattern occurs when considering whether to recompile
this method at level 1 or 2; initially recompiling at higher levels is not chosen (clock
time 151) until suﬃcient samples of the method have occurred (clock time
999).
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁgure also illustrates how samples of a method at lower optimization
level are incorporated into the total samples for a method that has been
recompiled. The samples at the lower level are scaled by the relative speed
of the two levels as deﬁned by the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CompilerDNA</span></span></span>, and used as the initial
number of samples for the higher level. For example, at clock time 100, the
baseline compiled version of the method has 9 samples. When the method is
recompiled at level 0, these methods are scaled down by 4<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>26, which is the
expected speedup deﬁned by the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">CompilerDNA</span></span></span> for going from baseline to
level 0, resulting in a value of 2<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>11. At clock time 160, the level 0 version
of method has 5<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>11 samples, i.e, 3 additional samples of the method have
occurred.

 id="x15-15700012.6"></a>Threading and Yieldpoints</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Jikes RVM creates a native thread for each Java thread that is started. Each
compiler generates yield points, which are program points where the running thread
checks to determine if it should yield to another thread. The compilers insert yield
                                                                  

                                                                  
points in method prologues, method epilogues, and on loop backedges.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The adaptive optimization system piggybacks on this yieldpoint mechanism to gather
proﬁle data. The thread scheduler provides an extension point by which the
runtime measurments component can install listeners that execute each time a
yieldpoint is taken. Such listeners primarily serve to sample program execution to
identify frequently-executed methods and call edges. Because these samples
occur at well-known locations (prologues, epilogues, and loop backedges), the
listener can easily attribute each sample to the appropriate Java source
method.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM implementation introduces a weakness with this mechanism, in that
samples can only occur in regions of code that have yieldpoints. Some low-level Jikes
RVM subsystems, such as the thread scheduler and the garbage collector, elide
yieldpoints because those regions of code rely on delicate state invariants
that preclude thread switching. These uninterruptible regions can distort
