<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The Jikes RVM adaptive system can also be used as a tool for gathering proﬁle data
to ﬁnd application/VM hotspots. In particular, the same low-overhead time-based
sampling mechanism that is used to drive recompilation decisions can also be used
to produce an aggregate proﬁle of the execution of an application. Here’s
how.
     </p><ol  class="enumerate1" >
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-99002x1">Build an adaptive conﬁguration of Jikes RVM. For the most accurate
     proﬁle, use the production conﬁguration.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-99004x2">Run  the  application  normally,  but  with  the  additional  command  line
     argument <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:aos:gather_profile_data=true</span></span></span>
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x10-99006x3">When the application terminates, data on which methods and call graph
     edges were sampled during execution will be printed to stdout (you may
     want to redirect execution to a ﬁle for analysis).</li></ol>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The sampled methods represent compiled versions of methods, so as methods are
recompiled and old versions are replaced some of the methods sampled earlier in the
run may be OBSOLETE by the time the proﬁle data is printed at the end of the
run.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the sampling-based mechanisms, the baseline compiler can inject code
to gather branch probabilites on all executed conditional branches. This proﬁling is
enabled by default in adaptive conﬁgurations of Jikes RVM and can be enabled via
the command line in non-adaptive conﬁgurations (<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:base:edge_counters=true</span></span></span>).
In an adaptive conﬁguration, use <br 
class="newline" /><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:aos:final_report_level=2</span></span></span> to cause the edge counter data to be dumped to a
ﬁle. In non-adaptive conﬁgurations, enabling edge counters implies that
the ﬁle should be generated (<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:base:edge_counters=true</span></span></span> is suﬃcient).
The default name of the ﬁle is EdgeCounters, which can be changed with
<br 
class="newline" /><span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">-X:base:edge_counter_file=&#x003C;file_name&#x003E;</span></span></span>. Note that the proﬁling is only injected
in baseline compiled code, so in a normal adaptive conﬁguration, the gathered
probabilities only represent a subset of program execution (branches in opt-compiled
code are not proﬁled). Note that unless the bootimage is (a) baseline compiled and
(b) edge counters were enabled at bootimage writing time, edge counter data will not
be gathered for bootimage code.

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >This section describes how the Jikes RVM optimizing compiler can be used to insert
counters in the optimized code to count the frequency of speciﬁc events.
Infrastructure for counting events is in place that hides many of the implementation
details of the counters, so that (hopefully) adding new code to count events should be
easy. All of the instrumentation phases described below require an adaptive boot
image (any one should work). The code regarding instrumentation lives in the

<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >This section describes the event counting infrastructure. It is not a step-by-step
for writing new phases, but instead is a description of the main ideas of
the counter infrastructure. This description, in combination with the above

phases.

class="cmbx-10">Counter Managers: </span>Counters are created and inserted into the code using the
<span 
class="cmtt-10">InstrumentedEventCounterManager </span>interface. The purpose of the counter
manager interface is to abstract away the implementation details of the
counters, making instrumentation phases simpler and allowing the counter
implementation to be changed easily (new counter managers can be used without
changing any of the instrumentation phases). Currently there exists only one
counter manager, <span 
class="cmtt-10">CounterArrayManager</span>, which implements unsynchronized
counters. When instrumentation options are turned on in the adaptive system,
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span

data that is managed using a counter manager. This purpose of the data
object is to maintain the mapping between the counters themselves (which
are indexed by number) and the events that they represent. For example,
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">StringEventCounterData</span></span></span> is used record the fact that counter #1 maps to the event
named ”FooBar”. Depending on what you are counting, there may be one
data object for the whole program (such as <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">YieldpointCounterData</span></span></span> and
<span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">MethodInvocationCounterData</span></span></span>), or one per method. There is also a generic data
object called <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span 
class="cmtt-10">StringEventCounterData</span></span></span> that allows events to be give string names
(see Debugging Counters above).

into the code. It also updates the instrumented counter to remember which counters
correspond to which events.

new phase, except that the <span class="obeylines-h"><span class="verb"><span
