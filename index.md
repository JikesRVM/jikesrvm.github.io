Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed
to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large
variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under an OSI
approved license. Jikes RVM runs on many platforms and
advances the state-of-the-art of virtual machine technologies for
dynamic compilation, adaptive optimization, garbage collection, thread
scheduling, and synchronization. A distinguishing characteristic of
Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Java™ programming language
and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without
requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for
the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A
Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless
integration of virtual machine and application resources such as
objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.
